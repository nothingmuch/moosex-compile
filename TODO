- MooseX::Compile::Compiler should be a Moose class itself. This is currently broken, haven't yet figured out why

- The compiler methods need better names. Most of them really really suck.

- Audit the code for extensibility
    - How easy is it to alter the structure of the PMC?
    - How easy is it to override minor details?
    - How easy is it to add support for new types of data (custom metaclasses,
      meta attrs, meta methods, code refs, etc)
        - meta caching could change
        - these object might also effect things in the PMC

- Sugar features
    - use Manip::END in addition to Check::UnitCheck as a compilation option
      (at_exit => 1) for better 5.8 support and also if the metaclass gets
      changed
    - Accept options like immutable => 1

- Inlinable & Deparsable code roles
    - Inlinable
        - just stupid macros with named parameters
    - Deparsable
        - serializable components
            - shared environment (shared per compilation unit) - like PadWalker::closed_over
            - private environment (per method) - like PadWalker::closed_over
            - body - perl text (B::Simple in the future)
        - mangling
            - alias mangled names from shared env to private names in private
              env?
            - look into DDS's mangling
        - extensible custom deparsing for closed values too

- add a no meta compilation option, for non introspectable classes which are
  completely Moose free
